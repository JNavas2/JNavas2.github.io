Hi John,

I would like to ask you again to delete the picture of me from your archive page (https://archive.ph/shhAj).

I know this is an archive site but sometimes times change. The political climate is getting rougher, if you know what I mean.

For some people it's better not to have their face on the internet anymore. Therefore I ask you again to remove this personal information.

Best regards

Chris
